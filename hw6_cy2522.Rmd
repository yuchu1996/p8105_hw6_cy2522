## Problem 1

(1)The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and we will use it as our dataset.
```{r}
## import the data
homicide_df = read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,",", state),
         solving_status = 
           ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1)) %>%
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX","Phoenix,AZ","Kansas City,MO","Tulsa,AL"))) %>%
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"),
         victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("white", "non-white")),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))

str(homicide_df)
  
```

(2)linear regression model For the city of Baltimore, MD
```{r}
homicide_fit_logistic = homicide_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD") %>%
  glm(solving_status ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, family = binomial(), data = .)
 
homi_or = homicide_fit_logistic%>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, OR)

homi_confidt = homicide_fit_logistic%>% 
  broom::confint_tidy() %>% 
    mutate(conf.low = exp(conf.low),
           conf.high = exp(conf.high))

cbind(homi_or, homi_confidt) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```


(3) for each of the cities
```{r}
or_confidt = function(homicide_data){
    fit_logistic = glm(solvingstatus ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = homicide_data, family = binomial())
    
    oddsr = fit_logistic %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    mutate(or = exp(estimate)) %>%
    select(term, or)
    
    confidt = fit_logistic %>% 
    broom::confint_tidy() %>% 
    mutate(conf.low = exp(conf.low),
           conf.high = exp(conf.high))
    
    output = cbind(oddsr, confidt) %>% 
      filter(term == "victim_racenon-white") %>% select(-term)
    
    output
}


```
